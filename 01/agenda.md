Day 1: Introduction to React for Web Developers
====

## Abstract

In this first course, Jonathan will introduce you to the most important parts of React, including the thinking behind it and core concepts. You’ll explore the new virtual DOM paradigm and learn how React differs from other JS libraries and when you’d want to use it. Then Jonathan will take you through each of the steps in creating a simple web app using ReactJS. At the end of this course, you’ll have a thorough understanding of React and a solid foundation for the more advanced topics that come later in this course series.

* Create your first component using React.createClass
* Learn about the virtual DOM (the JavaScript version of the actual DOM)
* Learn how to organize components into an application
* Learn about JSX, React’s new language that allows you to write HTML as syntax, which is transformed to lightweight JavaScript objects
* Get an introduction to state by rendering and re-rendering the virtual DOM

## Why me?

I've been working in the software business for 15+ years

* **Consultant** - I do mobile strategy for consumer brands like CVS, Staples, Nokia, Intel. I help them make the leap from their 90s era desktop-centric systems to a more future friendly.
* **Author** - I've written three books on mobile and web development, most notably "Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript" which has been translated in to 7 languages.
* **Developer** - I do a few dev projects every year to make sure my consulting advice stays fresh. Most recently I did the javascript for responsive redesigns of EW, Techcrunch, and some parts of Time Inc. In the fall of 2014, co-developed a Rails app called Castbacker which is a crowdfunding platform for podcasters.
* **CTO** - CTO of a bootstrapped SaaS startup called StickyAlbums that helps photographers market themselves with responsive HTML5 web apps.
* **Speaker** - I've spoken at over one hundred live events on three continents (e.g., SXSW, Adobe MAX, OSCON, etc).
* **Coach** - Business coaching for software developers to help them attract bigger clients, increase their profits, create recurring revenue, etc.

## React is different

* Eschews "Write Once, Run Everywhere"
    * Learn Once, Write Everywhere
* Eschews MVC
    * Sure, MVC saved us from spaghetti code but...
    * MVC separation of concerns is arbitrary
    * React separation of concerns is more realistic
* Optimized for developer delight
* Optimized for clarity, which is important because...
    * Large teams
    * Good xplat testing is virtually impossible
