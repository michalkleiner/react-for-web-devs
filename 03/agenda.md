Day 3: Building a Native iOS App with React
===

In this course you’ll discover how React Native makes the creation of native apps a breeze. You’ll see how React uses native iOS components, and then bring about changes to the UI through a JavaScript thread running in the background. The resulting application is surprisingly smooth and feels altogether native. Jonathan will demonstrate the process through examples and then you will work hands-on with your own app.
